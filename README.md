## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Note

This was my first project in React Native, and I learnt a lot from it. I found a lot of similarities to React, which I have used before (although definitely needed a refresher!), and also some differences. I also hadn't used TypeScript very extensively before, so this project was definitely a learning experience in that regard.

## Limitations

- Error catching could be more extensive, and more error states could be included
- Design of details and favorites pages could be improved to be more visually appealing
- Caching could be used to improve performance and reduce the number of times pokemon data needs to be retrieved
- This app was only tested on iOS, and so Android performance is unknown
